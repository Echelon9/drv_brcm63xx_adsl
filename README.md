# drv_brcm63xx_adsl

A Linux kernel driver for the brcm63xx ADSL module.
It targets this family of embedded Linux boards that provide an ADSL interface
as part of the SoC manufactured by Broadcom.

## Platform

Broadcom's 63xx SoC integrates ADSL/ADSL2+ features, routing and external
wireless NIC.

This SoC is widely used by most xDSL platforms in the world. It is one of
the most successful xDSL platforms due to the simplicity of migrating old
platforms (e.g BCM6345) to new onoes without much software development.

The architecture is based on a standard MIP32 Big Endian instruction set, and
shares some features with the R4000 microprocessor.

## Linux kernel driver functionality

xDSL and ATM have yet to be supported.
